NAME
    Config::Patch - Patch configuration files and unpatch them later

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::Patch;

        my $patcher = Config::Patch->new( 
            file => "/etc/syslog.conf",
            key  => "mypatch", 
        );

            # Append a patch:
        $patcher->append(q{
            # Log my stuff
            my.*         /var/log/my
        });

            # Appends the following to /etc/syslog.conf:
            *-------------------------------------------
            | ...
            | #(Config::Patch-Append-mypatch)
            | # Log my stuff
            | my.*         /var/log/my
            | #(Config::Patch-Append-mypatch)
            *-------------------------------------------

        # later on, to remove the patch:
        $patcher->remove();

DESCRIPTION
    "Config::Patch" helps changing configuration files, remembering the
    changes, and undoing them if necessary.

    Every change (patch) is marked by a *key*, which must be unique for the
    change, in order allow undoing it later on.

    To facilitate its usage, "Config::Patch" comes with a command line
    script that performs all functions:

            # Append a patch
        echo "my patch text" | config-patch -a -k key -f textfile

            # Remove a patch
        config-patch -r -k key -f textfile

METHODS
    "$patcher = Config::Patch->new(file => $file, key => $key)"
        Creates a new patcher object.

    "$patcher->append($textstring)"
        Appends a text string to the config file.

    "$patcher->remove()"
        Remove a previously applied patch.

    "$patcher->patched()"
        Checks if a patch with the given key was applied to the file
        already.

    "$patcher->replace($search, $replace)"
        Patches by searching for a given pattern $search (regexp) and
        replacing it by $replace.

    "$patcher->comment_out($search)"
        Patches by commenting out config lines matching the regular
        expression $search.

    "$hashref = $patcher->patches()"
        Returns a reference to a hash, mapping all patches within a file by
        key.

LIMITATIONS
    "Config::Patch" assumes that a hashmark (#) at the beginning of a line
    in the configuration file marks a comment.
